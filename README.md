# DETI-Store
The two projects I worked on for the Cybersecurity course.
1. Creating a basic e-commerce shop for our department that includes some vulnerabilities like SQL-Injection and XSS attacks and then creating a secure version.
2. Further improve security by conducting an audit of several CWEs and adding password strength evaluation and database encryption.
